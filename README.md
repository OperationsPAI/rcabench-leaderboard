# RCABench Leaderboard

**Language:** English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Reproducible CI/CD for all 12 algorithms reported by the FSE paper on FSE
RCABench and OPS-Lite. The repository pins every algorithm commit and dataset revision,
executes each datapack in Docker, calculates one canonical metric schema, and
publishes the latest results as a static leaderboard.

## What lives where

| Asset | Location |
|---|---|
| Benchmark controller, configs, results, site | This GitHub repository |
| Versioned telemetry datapacks and manifests | `HamsterStation/rcabench-fse` on Hugging Face |
| Immutable algorithm images | `ghcr.io/hamsterstation/rcabench-*` |
| Full evaluation compute | GitHub self-hosted runner labeled `rcabench` |
| Public result view | GitHub Pages deployment from `site/` |

The Hugging Face dataset and GitHub repository should remain private until the
original dataset redistribution terms have been confirmed.

## Pipeline

1. `config/algorithms.json` registers 12 algorithms and nine immutable images;
   `config/datasets.json` registers datasets. Each dataset config pins its
   revision, split sizes, resources, and error tolerances.
2. A new algorithm or dataset is proposed as a PR. `benchmark-pr.yml` detects
   only the affected algorithm × dataset pairs, builds candidate Linux/AMD64
   images, and evaluates them on the self-hosted server before merge.
3. Successful metrics are committed back to the PR and the bot squash-merges
   it automatically. Failed or incomplete evaluations remain open and cannot
   replace leaderboard values. `benchmark.yml` remains available for manual
   full or selected reruns.
4. ART and Eadro training outputs are cached by algorithm commit. A new data
   revision uses a fresh cache and retrains them.
5. Each datapack has an isolated log and atomic `result.json`; interrupted runs
   resume from existing valid result files.
6. `dataset-watch.yml` checks trusted Hugging Face repositories daily. A new
   revision regenerates deterministic splits and opens an auditable evaluation
   PR; the same PR gate runs metrics before automatic merge.
7. Metrics are validated, archived under `results/history/`, promoted to
   `results/leaderboard.json`, and deployed by `pages.yml`.

Dataset PRs first pass a cloud-only schema, immutable Hugging Face revision,
manifest partition, and sampled ground-truth check. Fork PRs never receive secrets or
run on the self-hosted server. After maintainer promotion to a trusted same-repository
branch, the PR expands to every registered algorithm and follows the metric/merge gate.

The registry contains BARO, ART, Eadro, CausalRCA, DiagFusion, MicroDig,
MicroHECL, MicroRank, MicroRCA, Nezha, ShapleyIQ, and SimpleRCA. DiagFusion's
released container uses its bundled checkpoint; those rows are marked with
that checkpoint policy and should not be described as leakage-free retraining
on a newly added dataset until a training adapter is implemented.

## Local commands

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

rcabench-leaderboard validate
rcabench-leaderboard doctor
rcabench-leaderboard download --output .cache/datasets/v1.0.0
```

Prepare the pinned OPS-Lite snapshot. This preserves the raw cases, creates a
compatible case view, and generates a deterministic 400/100 split balanced on
system, fault, service, and fault-service marginals:

```bash
rcabench-leaderboard download --config config/ops-lite.json \
  --output .cache/datasets/ops-lite
rcabench-leaderboard normalize --adapter ops-lite \
  --config config/ops-lite.json --snapshot .cache/datasets/ops-lite
```

Run BARO on the first five cases:

```bash
rcabench-leaderboard run baro \
  --snapshot .cache/datasets/v1.0.0 \
  --output runs/baro-smoke \
  --limit 5

rcabench-leaderboard evaluate baro \
  --snapshot .cache/datasets/v1.0.0 \
  --results runs/baro-smoke \
  --output runs/baro-smoke/metrics.json \
  --limit 5 --require-complete
```

ART and Eadro require a training preparation step:

```bash
rcabench-leaderboard prepare art --snapshot .cache/datasets/v1.0.0
rcabench-leaderboard prepare eadro --snapshot .cache/datasets/v1.0.0
```

## Metric contract

- `Top@1`, `Top@3`, `Top@5`, `Avg@3`, `Avg@5`, and `MRR` use the requested
  manifest size as their denominator. Missing or invalid results are misses.
- Duplicate service names are removed from rankings before scoring.
- Per-case algorithm exceptions are serialized as auditable misses. The CI
  fails if their count exceeds the configured tolerance.
- Rankings are compared at service level against every service listed in
  `injection.json` ground truth.
- OPS-Lite cases can contain two root services. Evaluation accepts either root;
  ART/Eadro training uses the first listed root because their released label
  pipelines are single-label.

## Operations

See [docs/SETUP.zh-CN.md](docs/SETUP.zh-CN.md) for deployment and recovery, and
[docs/DATASET_PR.zh-CN.md](docs/DATASET_PR.zh-CN.md) for the generic dataset PR flow.

For maintainers who are joining the project, the shortest path from a clean
checkout to a reproducible run is documented in
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.zh-CN.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.zh-CN.md). It covers repository
boundaries, local reproduction, new algorithm and dataset development, and the
manual Actions entry points.

## Repository move

The canonical home is now
`OperationsPAI/rcabench-leaderboard`. GitHub preserves the previous repository
URLs as redirects after an organization transfer, but scripts and citations
should use the canonical URL. The benchmark data repository and any server storage remain separate;
moving this repository does not copy datasets, caches, checkpoints, or prior
results.

## What is public

This repository publishes the evaluation controller, immutable algorithm
references, metric history, and the static leaderboard. The paper's modified
Train-Ticket microservice image archive and a complete digest manifest are not
currently part of this repository. Do not substitute the RCA algorithm images
listed in `config/algorithms.json` for Train-Ticket service images; publish a
redacted manifest and fixed deployment revision only after the corresponding
artifact and license checks are complete.
